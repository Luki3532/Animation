I want to make a program where i can upload a video and then use my drawing pad or mouse and keyboard to trace over it where i will then have a new video that will be an animation. this is a manual key frame/end animation tool. We need to make a toolset for colors shapes pens erase and selector tools to begin aswell as a way to choose canvas size e.g 32x32 or 64x64. users can upload the video, use arrow keys to change the frame and draw over each frame asyncrosnounly, finally they can export the animation which takes only what the user has drawn and gennerate a sprite sheet
